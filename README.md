> test Apple Push Notification with ease

## Quick Start

### Use it Online

APN Tester on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://apn-tester.streamlit.app)

### Install Locally

`pip install "httpx[http2]" cryptography pyjwt streamlit watchdog`

Then run it with [streamlit]

`streamlit run main.py`

### Work with Simulator

Edit the bundle ID and payloads in `simulator-payload.apns` then drag it to the simulator.

Or, edit `simulator.py` then run `python simulator.py`

## Motivation

### The Problem

- I need to send push notifications to test APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) for my iOS projects.
- Using push service providers like [Pusher](https://pusher.com) can be complicated. Typically, they require:
    - Installing and learning how to use their client library on both the iOS app and the server side.
    - Setting up a server to send push notifications.

### What I Want

- Avoid installing third-party libraries in my iOS project that would clutter the codebase.
- Avoid setting up a server just to send a few push notifications.
- Use a simple and user-friendly web UI to send push notifications easily - so here you go! ðŸš€
